Sensei - Executive Summary

The Problem:
Note-making is a challenging skill that requires students to divide their attention
between listening and writing in most classrooms across the world. Students
often struggle to capture everything the teacher says, and consequently, they
fail to comprehend or organize the information effectively. Even with
comprehensive notes, many students have difficulty reviewing the material
covered in the classroom. Moreover, learners with mental disabilities and
disorders need assistance in accomplishing immediate tasks without
compromising their social interactions with other students. There is an urgent
need for transformation from a traditional classroom system that can
accommodate the diverse learning abilities and create a safe and inclusive
learning environment. Additionally, as class sizes grow, teachers face the
challenge of providing individual feedback to each student while meeting
deadlines and completing their curriculum. Therefore, a technological solution is
essential to modernize our classrooms and create more productive, inclusive
and safe spaces for all.

The Hypothesis:
An AI-based Teaching Assistant app can address some of the common
challenges that learners face, such as social interaction, class pace, and
material comprehension. The app can automate the tedious task of note-taking,
allowing students to focus on the lesson. The app should also provide audio
playback of parts of the lesson with student-made annotations, enhancing the
understanding of the subject. Moreover, the app can use computer vision to
monitor the attentiveness of the students and inform the teacher, especially in
large classes. These features can improve the learning outcomes and create a
more inclusive environment for all learners.

The Solution:
Sensei: The AI Teaching Assistant!
Our application can automate the tedious task of note-taking, allowing students
to focus on the lesson at hand. Students can add their own annotations, which
are saved with accurate timestamps for later review via Sensei’s novel
Annotation Viewer. Sensei enables students to direct their focus towards
learning the material being taught in the classroom, and provides well-written
study notes to aid their retention of the material.
Sensei automates the note-taking process, saving students time and energy.
Sensei enhances the learning experience, allowing students to add their own
annotations and review them later with audio excerpts from the lesson via the
Annotation Viewer.
Sensei supports students with learning disabilities, providing them with clear
and concise study notes that capture the main ideas of the lesson.
The Sensei app utilizes the powerful Mistral Large Language Model, along with
an optimized version of OpenAI’s Whisper Transcription Model to seamlessly
produce well-written notes from lengthy lectures.
The Sensei app is designed to run completely locally on the user’s computer
(with an NVIDIA GPU) delivering unparalleled performance and powerefficiency
at zero cost to the user.
